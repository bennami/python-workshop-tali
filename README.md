## What is Django?

Django is a web application framework written in Python.

## Why is it handy?

Django is a fast, versatile and secure framework. It takes care of user authentication, content administration, site maps, RSS feeds, and many more tasks â€” right out of the box.

## What will we be building?

We will be making a CV builder website, where a user can input their information and render their CV in a pre-made template. This way, you will get a hands-on introduction to form handling, data management, styling and authentication within Django.

## What do you need for the workshop
- Python3.8
- Pip (this should already come with Python but make sure to [upgrade](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) it)
- Install virtualenv:
  
  `sudo pip3 install virtualenv  / sudo pip install virtualenv`

- Yourself

# See you there!
